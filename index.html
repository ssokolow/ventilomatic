  <h1>Synopsis</h1>
  <p>Ventilomatic is an experimental environmental monitoring and control
    project built using Arduino and Raspberry Pi hardware.</p>

  <p>While built using solderless components and not envisioned for permanent
     installation, this first version is intended to reach full functionality
     before being dismantled.</p>

  <p>(The hardware design used is perfectly functional... just bulky, ugly,
    and power-hungry compared to the 3.0 or 4.0 revisions eventually intended
    to operate using a mixture of LAN communication and battery-driven
    low-power radio. As such, there is no reason <em>not</em> to bring the
    software side of the project to a complete state.)</p>
